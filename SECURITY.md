# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently only support latest version.
If maintenance branch would be needed, we can deploy a 
maintenance program

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report vulnerability by contacting me loopingz@loopingz.com, or create a GitHub issue in this repository.

To avoid the 0-day exploitation, an email might be better if the vulnerability is critical and requires immediate patching, so we can fix it within the 90 days grace window.
